            I currently work as a Senior Educator with Brainstation, a company dedicated to helping folks from all backgrounds learn new skills. I teach the full-time software engineering bootcamp, working with students from their first steps in HTML/CSS all the way to building full stack capstone projects using React, Node, and MySQL.

                Enticed by their mission to help patients receive better healthcare
                around the clock, I joined Wellframe in 2019 to become part of a much
                smaller team of engineers focused on a specific product. My main
                responsibility was the Wellframe Dashboard, a web page where care
                managers manage and communicate with their patients.
            </>
            <>I was responsible for the development and deployment of several
                new features while at Wellframe, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A new platform for our clinical team to upload articles and attach
                        them to content bundles viewable by patients and care teams
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A way for care managers to create custom message templates with
                        autofilled shortcuts to send to patients
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A brand new component library for use throughout all the Wellframe
                        frontend applications
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Wellframe's stack consisted of a React & Typescript app for the care
                manager dashboard, served by both a Rails API as well as several
                Spring Boot microservices. These service were deployed via GCP, using
                GitLab for CI/CD.

        description: () => <>
            My first role was with Slalom Build, working as a developer on several
            different "scrum teams for hire". During my two years with Slalom
            Build I worked with five different teams, each serving a different
            client. Among these projects (company names omitted to avoid privacy
            issues) were:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Working on a proof of concept for an Alexa-controlled faucet
                </li>
                <li>Modernizing a set of tools for developing new paints</li>
                <li>
                    Developing an API for a web app used by in-store stylists to query
                    wedding dress inventory
                </li>
            </ul>
            Each project involved a completely new stack, giving me the
            opportunity to learn several new technologies in a professional
            setting, including React, Angular, AWS Lambda, .NET Framework, MSSQL
            Server, and many others. Over the course of my two years, I was
            promoted to Senior Engineer and began to hone my skills as a full
            stack web developer.
